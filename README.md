• The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed. Each person performed six activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

• Built various ML classification models to classify the activities, being able to understand and precisely identify human fitness activities.

• Built supervised neural network using multi-layer perceptron in classification and deployed of Keras Deep learning algorithm.

• Compared the goodness of different models and applied grid search for model selection.
